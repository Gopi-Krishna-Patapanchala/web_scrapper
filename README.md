# Web scrapper
The web scraper was created entirely using the RUST programming language. This tool is designed to extract data from one of the most popular sports websites, ESPNCricinfo.com. With this project, you can scrape cricket data from any format, like IPL, T20, ODI, and Test available on ESPNCricinfo. All you have to do is provide the scorecard URL in the match_config_url.txt file. If you want, you can provide more than one scorecard URL in the config file.
